ABAGAIL - jython
=======

- [Install jython](https://www.jython.org/)
- Run the [bat](https://github.com/pushkar/ABAGAIL/blob/master/jython/run.bat) or [shell](https://github.com/pushkar/ABAGAIL/blob/master/jython/run.sh) file first to add the ABAGAIL jar to your classpath.  

For Part1:
The main codes are in the "jython" file. Therefore are many algorithms under this file, I use the travelsalesman.py, nqueens.py, and countones.py for Part1.If you want to run the code, go to the "jython" file, and run "run.bat". If you run the travelingsalesman.py, go to modify the "run.bat", and uncomment the ":: " for travelingsalesman, also comment the current uncomment one. It you run another problem (such as nqueen or countones).py, do this again.
After running the "run.bat" file, the data has been save in the "data" file, it you want to plot it, run the "python countones_plot.py"or "python travelsalesman_plot.py" or "python nqueens_plot.py" in the Powershell under the jython file.

For Part2:
The main codes are in the "jython" file, run the "NN-Backprop", "NN-GA", "NN-RHC", and "NN-SA", you can get the data for part2, they all stored in the "data" file. You can plot the data by running the "plotting.py".
